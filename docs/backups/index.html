    <h2>
      What is a design history
    </h2>

    <p>When designing and building a service, it can be easy to forget why previous decisions were made, even more so as
      new people join the team and others leave. A design history can help by creating a permanent record.</p>

    <p>A design history site is like a blog, with posts describing the development of new features, iterations of
      existing ones or findings from user research â€“ anything that may be useful to return to later.</p>

      {{ details({
        "classes": "nhsuk-expander",
        "text": "Key points of the design history",
        "HTML": "
        <p>Having the design history means you could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>re-evaluate decisions</li>
          <li>see how a feature changed over time</li>
          <li>see how things tested in research</li>
          <li>give context to new team members</li>
          <li>demonstrate reasons why certain features did not work</li>
          <li>create snapshots of how things looked at significant milestones</li>
          <li>share design decisions across government</li>
          <li>share everything with service assessors</li>
        </ul>"
